# Hello! ðŸ‘‹
Here, you can find some of the projects I've worked on, competently or otherwise.

## About me
- Much of my recent interest has been involved with graphics and rendering (see my voxel engine), but I've also worked quite a bit with web development, specifically web apps with React and various back end technologies.
- Some hobbies of mine include running cross country and track, speedcubing, and skiing.
