# Hello! ðŸ‘‹
Here, you can find some of the projects I've worked on, competently or otherwise.

## About me
- I enjoy programming in Pyhthon, JavaScript/TypeScript the most, but I also know Java (C coming soon!).
- Much of my work on here has been focused on web development, specifically web apps with React and various back end technologies
- In the future, I'm looking to get more into lower level programming, but I've greatly enjoyed the work I've done thus far!
- Some hobbies of mine include running cross country and track, speedcubing, and skiing.
